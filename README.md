# Hotstar-Account-Sharing-Service
This Git repository contains the source code for a web-based service that helps Hotstar users share their One-Time Passwords (OTPs) with friends and family. Our platform is designed to assist in sharing OTPs, which are sent to the owner of the Hotstar account, allowing others to access the premium content without having to share OTPs manually.
